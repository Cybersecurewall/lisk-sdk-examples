# Lisk Invoice Client
This is the client to the Invoice SDK PoC

## Installation
You need the Invoice backend set up and running on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), as described in [/invoice/README.md](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/invoice/README.md)

Once the backend is up and running, go to client and install dependencies.

```sh
cd ./client
npm i 
```

## Run the client

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
